# Plants vs Interview - AI Mock Interview Assistant

### _About Our Project_

As a team of junior and senior college students, while we know that interviews play a key role in the hiring process, we also recognized how difficult it is to prepare and practice without feedback. That's why we created a web platform that makes interview practice more engaging, asseccible, and rewarding for everyone. To help users, we provide AI-powered industry specific questions and feeback. To add an element of motivation, we introduced Finn, a virtual plant that grows the more you practice. 

### _What it does_
* Allows users to create an account to track their interview preparation progress
* Generates interview questions tailored to the user’s chosen field and major
* Provides AI-generated feedback, including a rating out of 10, strengths, weaknesses, and insights into what interviewers may look for in responses
* Offer users the ability to bookmark questions, track their last practice date, and see their progress over time
* Incorporate a gamified system where users “water” Finn, their virtual plant, to encourage daily practice and growth

### _How we built it_
* Frontend: React.js with Tailwind for an interactive UI.
* Backend: Clerk and Firebase for authentication, storage, and real-time database management.
* AI Integration: OpenAI's API to generate interview questions and assess responses.
* Graphics: Pixilart to create plant graphics and establish a polished yet playful design.

### _What's next for Plants vs. Interview_
* Accessibility improvements: Speech-to-text integration, text-to-speech support, high-contrast themes, and adjustable text sizes
* Usability improvements: Add additional details to the landing page regarding our product. Provide a tutorial on where to access different features
* Streak tracking & rewards: Encourage users to practice daily with streaks and milestone achievements
* More customization: Users can personalize their plant and unlock new plant designs. They will also be able to choose different themes
* Expanded question database: Support for more industries and interview formats
